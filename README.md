# CrisisCore — India Disaster Intelligence Map

> **AI-powered disaster monitoring, risk assessment, and emergency resource intelligence for India.**

CrisisCore 2.0 is an India-focused disaster intelligence platform designed to bring multiple disaster data sources into a single interactive system.

The platform combines **real-time and near-real-time disaster information, AI-based risk assessment, weather intelligence, geospatial visualization, and emergency resource discovery** into one unified dashboard.

The system is designed to help users understand:

- Where disasters are occurring
- What types of disasters are currently active
- How severe the overall risk is
- What the local weather conditions are
- Where hospitals and emergency shelters are located
- How disaster risk changes according to geographic location
- How multiple disaster data sources can be combined into one intelligence layer

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

India is highly exposed to multiple natural hazards including:

- 🌊 Floods        - 🌍 Earthquakes         - 🌵 Droughts         - 🔥 Heatwaves          - 🌀 Cyclones

Disaster information is often distributed across different systems, agencies, datasets, and geographical services.
CrisisCore attempts to solve this fragmentation by providing a centralized **India Disaster Intelligence Map**.
The platform collects disaster-related information from multiple sources, processes the information through backend services and AI-based risk analysis, and presents the results through an interactive web dashboard.

# ✨ Key Features

## 🗺️ 1. India-Wide Disaster Intelligence Map

The central feature of CrisisCore 2.0 is an interactive map covering India.

The map provides geographic visualization of disaster-related information and emergency resources.

### Supported map layers

- 🌊 Flood
- 🌍 Earthquake
- 🌵 Drought
- 🔥 Heatwave
- 🌀 Cyclone
- 🏥 Hospitals
- 🏠 Shelters

The map is implemented using **Leaflet** through **React Leaflet**.

---

# 🌊 2. Flood Monitoring

CrisisCore includes a satellite-based flood monitoring module designed around:

- Sentinel-1 satellite data
- Google Earth Engine
- Geospatial processing

The flood service is designed to use the latest available Sentinel-1 satellite data.

### Google Earth Engine

The flood-processing pipeline requires Google Earth Engine authentication.

If Earth Engine has not been authenticated, the application safely reports the flood service as unavailable rather than pretending that flood data exists.

---

# 🌍 3. Earthquake Monitoring

CrisisCore integrates earthquake information from the **USGS**.

The earthquake service provides India-relevant earthquake events and exposes them through the backend.

Earthquake events are displayed on the interactive map using geographic markers whose visual size can represent magnitude.

---

# 🌵 4. Drought Monitoring

The platform includes a drought analysis layer based on weather-related information.

Drought information is processed through the backend disaster services and incorporated into the overall disaster intelligence system.

Drought conditions can contribute to the AI-based risk assessment.

---

# 🔥 5. Heatwave Monitoring

CrisisCore includes a heatwave monitoring service based on weather information.

The system analyzes local weather conditions and identifies areas experiencing potentially elevated heat-related conditions.

Heatwave information contributes to:

- Disaster visualization
- Risk analysis
- Overall risk calculation

---

# 🌀 6. Cyclone Monitoring

The platform includes cyclone monitoring capabilities for Indian regions.

Cyclone information can be visualized geographically and incorporated into the overall disaster risk engine.

The system is designed to support:

- Cyclone location information
- Severity information
- Geographic visualization
- Risk contribution

---

# 🤖 7. AI-Powered Risk Assessment

One of the core components of CrisisCore 2.0 is its AI-based disaster risk engine.

The system combines information from multiple disaster types and analyzes the available information to produce an overall risk assessment.

The AI layer includes anomaly-detection models for:

- 🌊 Flood
- 🌍 Earthquake
- 🔥 Heatwave
- 🌵 Drought
- 🌀 Cyclone

The current implementation uses **Isolation Forest-based models** for anomaly detection.

---

# ⚠️ 8. Overall Risk Dashboard

The frontend provides an overall risk card that summarizes the current disaster risk.

Possible risk levels include:

- 🟢 LOW
- 🟡 MEDIUM
- 🟠 HIGH
- 🔴 CRITICAL
- ⚪ UNAVAILABLE

---

# 🌦️ 9. Location-Based Weather Intelligence

CrisisCore integrates weather information using **OpenWeather**.

---

# 📍 10. Automatic User Location Detection

When supported by the browser, CrisisCore attempts to determine the user's geographic location using browser geolocation.

The detected coordinates are used for location-specific services such as:

- Weather
- AI risk assessment
- Nearest hospitals
- Nearest shelters
- 
---

# 🏥 11. Emergency Hospital Discovery

CrisisCore provides hospital information using **OpenStreetMap-based geographic data**.

The nearest hospital can also be surfaced through the dashboard's resource information.

---

# 🏠 12. Emergency Shelter Discovery

The platform also provides emergency shelter information using OpenStreetMap geographic data.

Shelter-related resources are identified using OpenStreetMap tags such as:

- Social facilities
- Community centres
- Shelter-related facilities
- Relief-related facilities
- Refuge-related facilities
- Emergency-related facilities

---

# 🚨 13. Disaster Alerts

The backend generates disaster alerts based on detected disaster information.

The frontend can filter alerts according to severity.

---

# 🧠 14. Multi-Source Disaster Intelligence

CrisisCore does not depend on a single data provider.

The current system combines information from multiple sources:

| Data | Source |
|---|---|
| Flood monitoring | Sentinel-1 / Google Earth Engine |
| Earthquakes | USGS |
| Weather | OpenWeather |
| Drought analysis | OpenWeather |
| Heatwave analysis | OpenWeather |
| Cyclone analysis | OpenWeather |
| Hospitals | OpenStreetMap |
| Shelters | OpenStreetMap |
| Geographic visualization | Leaflet / OpenStreetMap |

This multi-source approach allows the platform to combine different forms of environmental and geographic intelligence.

The map starts with an India-wide view.

Approximate India map bounds are configured so that the primary map remains focused on India.

Users can:

1. Zoom into a region.
2. Pan across the country.
3. Enable or disable disaster layers.
4. Enable hospital and shelter layers.
5. Inspect individual markers.
6. Select geographic locations.
7. Run map-based flood analysis where the flood service is available.

---

# 🔬 AI / Machine Learning Pipeline

The AI risk engine uses anomaly detection models to identify unusual or potentially hazardous conditions.

The current model architecture includes separate models for different disaster types.

The flood service is designed around satellite-based analysis of geographic regions.

## Google Earth Engine

Used to access and process satellite-based geospatial information for the flood module.

## USGS

Used for earthquake event information.

## OpenWeather

Used for location-specific weather and weather-derived disaster analysis.

## OpenStreetMap

Used for geographic resource information including hospitals and shelters.

## Overpass API

```

---




The assistant can use the existing disaster intelligence context instead of relying only on general-purpose responses.

---

# 📈 Scalability Considerations

CrisisCore is designed with a modular backend architecture.

Each disaster type is implemented as a separate service.

This allows additional data sources and disaster types to be added without completely rewriting the application.

The architecture can be extended to support:

```text
New Data Source
      ↓
New Service
      ↓
Risk Engine
      ↓

# 💡 Why CrisisCore ?

Traditional disaster information systems may require users to consult multiple sources to understand a developing situation.

CrisisCore attempts to simplify this process by providing a unified interface.

Instead of separately checking:

```text
Weather
+
Earthquakes
+
Flood information
+
Cyclones
+
Drought
+
Heatwaves
+
Hospitals
+
Shelters
```

the platform brings them together:
